      <h3>Dietary Guidelines</h3>
      <img src="diet.jpg" alt="dietary healthy meals" style="width:275px; height:183px;">
      <p> 
        Healthy eating patterns can be adapted to an individualâ€™s budget, taste preferences, traditions, and
        culture. We offer dietary guidelines that emphasize on the importance of these eating patterns. This involves
         the combination of ALL foods and beverages a person consumes regularly over time, rather than
         focusing on individual nutrients or foods in isolation. Healthy eating patterns, along with  regular
         physical activity, have been known to help people reach and maintain good
         health while reducing risks of chronic disease throughout their lives.  </p>
